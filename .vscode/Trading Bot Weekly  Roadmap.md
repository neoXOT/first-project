    Build a simple CLI price tracker (CoinGecko API)

    Add auto-email or Telegram notification with smtplib or telebot

Week 3: APIs + Git

    Learn Git, GitHub (commit, push, pull, clone, branch)

    Use ccxt to connect to Binance testnet or Bitget

    📘 Mini Project: Python script to fetch OHLCV and store in CSV

Week 4: Organize Your First Trading Bot Repo

    Create a repo structure: /strategies, /data, /logs, /config

    Modularize your price tracker + testnet trader

    CLI tool to fetch current balance, PnL, latest prices

📊 PHASE 2: Strategy Engine + Market Simulation (Weeks 5–8)

Goal: Build basic strategies, test them, and start logging results.
Week 5: Backtesting Basics

    Learn candlestick data structures

    Use Backtrader or bt to simulate simple RSI/MA strategy

    📘 Project: Backtest RSI + Moving Average crossover

Week 6: Simple Live Bot on Testnet

    Connect to Binance/Bitget testnet via ccxt

    Execute mock trades with logic from your backtests

    Log entries, exits, profits to a file

Week 7: Create Strategy Framework

    Create a modular bot: strategy class + order manager + logger

    Add config: strategy_name, symbols, capital, sl/tp

    Paper trade ETH/BTC using your best strategy so far

Week 8: Logging & Risk Management

    Add SL, TP, trailing stop, cooldown period, max trades per day

    Use .env to hide API keys

    📘 Mini Project: Dashboard script to show balance, profit, trades

🧠 PHASE 3: Machine Learning Integration (Weeks 9–14)

Goal: Train your bot to “learn” from historical and live data.
Week 9: ML Foundations

    Learn: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn basics

    Supervised learning: regression, classification

    📘 Project: Predict “up” or “down” from 15-min OHLCV

Week 10: Feature Engineering + Labeling

    Create features: MA, RSI, MACD, candle shapes, volume ratios

    Label candles (e.g., will next candle go up 1%?)

    Train model + export predictions

Week 11: Integrate ML with Bot

    Use prediction to decide entry/exit

    Run live paper trades based on model outputs

    Log confidence score + outcome

Week 12: Improve Accuracy

    Try different models: RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM

    Add sentiment analysis: scrape crypto news or Twitter using snscrape

    📘 Mini Project: Trade if both model + sentiment agree

Week 13: Time Series Forecasting

    Learn ARIMA, LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow) for price prediction

    Train on BTC hourly data and try to forecast short-term trend

Week 14: Model Evaluation + Fine-Tuning

    Log accuracy, precision, recall, profit per model

    Save best-performing models using joblib

    Add model update schedule (weekly retrain)

🔁 PHASE 4: Adaptive Logic + Reinforcement Light (Weeks 15–18)

Goal: Self-improving behavior: adapt based on results.
Week 15: Bot Self-Evaluation Logic

    Add reward system (e.g., +1 if win, -1 if loss)

    Log patterns from winning trades

Week 16: Strategy Mutation

    Modify strategy parameters slightly if loss streak detected

    Simulate "evolution": pick top 2 strategies, mutate one

Week 17: Behavior Modules

    Add emotional logic: avoid revenge trading, force cooldowns

    Decision tree: aggressive during high volatility, conservative during chop

Week 18: Paper vs Real Test Comparison

    Compare paper and testnet trade accuracy

    Run bot live with small capital ($10–20 max)

☁️ PHASE 5: Infrastructure & Deployment (Weeks 19–22)

Goal: Make bot reliable, modular, and hosted.
Week 19: Dockerize It

    Learn Docker: write a Dockerfile, expose bot

    Run your bot in a container

Week 20: Set Up Server or VPS

    Host on Ubuntu server or local machine 24/7

    Use tmux, supervisor, or systemd to auto-restart bot

Week 21: FastAPI or Flask Interface

    Control bot via API: start, stop, get logs, show PnL

    Optional: add a lightweight HTML UI

Week 22: Finalize Logging & Alerts

    Use PostgreSQL or SQLite for trade logs

    Set up email or Telegram alerts for bot activity

    📘 Bonus Project: Create a front-end dashboard with React or just HTML/CSS

🚀 PHASE 6: Polish + Live Deployment (Weeks 23–24+)

    Final testing, audits, and smart capital deployment

Week 23: Stress Test + Fail Safes

    Simulate API downtime, internet cut-off, bad data

    Set hard trade cap, kill-switch, performance monitor

Week 24: Live with Capital

    Start trading with small capital and scale only after:

        Consistent wins in paper/live test

        2+ strategies with good win rate

        Full logs and confidence in infra

🔥 Optional Power-Ups:

    🤖 Integrate GPT to help auto-tune parameters

    🧠 Explore Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO)

    🌐 Add cross-chain trading between exchanges (arbitrage, etc.)
